  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 04 September 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the <strong>One Page Budget</strong> mobile application (“the App”) developed and maintained by <strong>Meliorem Digital Agency</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By downloading or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
  <p>One Page Budget provides personal budgeting tools, including budget tracking, expected vs. actual comparisons, custom categories, account reconciliation, and related features. The App is provided for informational and personal financial management purposes only and is <strong>not financial advice</strong>.</p>

  <h2>2. Accounts and Eligibility</h2>
  <p>The App does not require user accounts at this time. Future versions may introduce optional account features (e.g., cloud sync). If accounts are added, you will be required to accept updated Terms.</p>
  <p>You must be at least 18 years old, or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, to use the App. The App is not directed to children.</p>

  <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The App may offer paid subscription options, such as ad-free use or premium features.</li>
    <li>Subscriptions are managed through your app store account (Google Play, Apple App Store). Billing, renewals, and cancellations are handled by the respective store, subject to their policies.</li>
    <li>Prices are displayed in your local currency. Taxes may apply depending on your jurisdiction.</li>
    <li><strong>Grandfathered pricing:</strong> Users who subscribe at a given price may keep that price as long as their subscription remains active and uninterrupted. Cancelling a subscription forfeits grandfathered pricing.</li>
    <li><strong>Price changes:</strong> We may update subscription prices. You will be notified by your app store provider and given the option to accept or cancel before the new price takes effect.</li>
    <li>Refunds are managed by the app store according to their rules.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Advertisements</h2>
  <p>The App displays ads, including through Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) and other partners. By using the App, you agree to the display of ads unless you purchase a subscription that removes them. In regions requiring consent (e.g., GDPR/CCPA jurisdictions), we use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to collect and respect your choices regarding personalized vs. non-personalized ads.</p>

  <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to misuse the App, interfere with its operation, attempt unauthorized access, or use the App in violation of any applicable law.</p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content, trademarks, and intellectual property within the App are owned by or licensed to Meliorem Digital Agency. You are granted a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>The App is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or meet your specific needs. One Page Budget is a financial management tool and does not provide professional financial advice.</p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Meliorem Digital Agency shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

  <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of South Africa, without regard to conflict of law principles. Disputes shall be resolved in the courts of South Africa unless otherwise required by local consumer protection laws.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Updates will be posted in the App and/or on our website. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
