  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 04 September 2025</p>

  <p><strong>One Page Budget</strong> (“the App”) is developed and maintained by <strong>Meliorem Digital Agency</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how the App and its third-party services process your information.</p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>This policy applies to the Android/iOS application <em>One Page Budget</em> and our related public web pages. It does not apply to external websites we link to.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your budgeting data is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device using a local database (SQLite/Drift).</li>
    <li>We display ads through <strong>Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob)</strong>. By default, ads may be non-personalized. In supported regions, you may choose whether to allow personalized ads.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information.</li>
    <li>If we introduce cloud sync or other new features, this policy will be updated and you will be notified in advance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data We Process</h2>
  <h3>1) Data You Enter</h3>
  <p>Categories, transactions, expected vs. actual amounts, and settings you add in the App are stored locally on your device. We do not automatically upload this data to our servers. If optional cloud sync is introduced in the future, you will be able to choose whether to use it.</p>

  <h3>2) Advertising Data</h3>
  <p>We use <strong>Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob)</strong> to show ads. The SDK and its partners may process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising ID and other device identifiers</li>
    <li>IP address and approximate location (for fraud prevention and ad relevance)</li>
    <li>Device information (model, OS version, app version)</li>
    <li>Ad interaction events (impressions, clicks, error logs)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Depending on your region and consent, ads may be personalized. In the EU/UK and other regions where required, we use Google’s <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> to collect and respect your ad consent choices.</p>
  <p>More details: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Google Privacy & Terms</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9012903">AdMob & consent</a>.</p>

  <h2>Your Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent (EEA/UK, some US states):</strong> You will see a consent dialog (Google UMP) to select personalized vs. non-personalized ads. You may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>OS-level Ads Personalization:</strong> On Android, you can reset your Advertising ID or opt out of Ads Personalization in system settings (<em>Settings → Google → Ads</em>).</li>
    <li><strong>In-App:</strong> A link to this Privacy Policy is always available in the App’s Settings page. Where required, we provide a way to reopen the consent dialog.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We share data only with Google (AdMob) to deliver ads. We do not sell your data. If required by law, we may disclose information to authorities.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local budget data:</strong> stays on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad data:</strong> retained by Google/partners according to their own retention and legal requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is <strong>not directed to children</strong>. We do not knowingly show personalized ads to children or collect children’s data. If we become aware of such collection, we will remove it.</p>

  <h2>Future Features</h2>
  <p>If we add optional cloud sync, account creation, or other features that involve additional data collection, we will update this policy and request your consent where legally required before those features go live.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as the App evolves. Updates will be posted here and the “last updated” date will change. In cases of major changes (e.g., introducing cloud sync), we will notify users in-app.</p>
